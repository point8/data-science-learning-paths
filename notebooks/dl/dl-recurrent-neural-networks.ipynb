That gives the network the ability of **sequential memory**."

    "When training _deep_ neural networks, we can experience an issue - the **[vanishing gradient problem](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-vanishing-gradient-problem?share=1)**: During gradient-based training, some layers may receive only tiny updates to their weights, leading to a lengthy or unsuccessful learning process. For feedforward neural networks, the issue is caused by the depth of the network and the choice of activation functions, and can be fixed accordingly (popular: the ReLU activation).\n",
