    "\n",
    "When Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum was pursuing, in his own words, \"a hobby programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas\" in 1989 and decided to name it **\"Python\"**, he did this indeed as a fan of the British surreal comedy group [**Monty Python**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python). You are going to find plenty of insider references to Monty Python's work in Python programming examples. We are going to follow this tradition with this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "The TV shows and films of the group have made each member an icon in the world of comedy, and the members have also pursued independent careers. But, which one of them has gained most fame and notability, thereby becoming perhaps the greatest name in British surreal commedy?  And did any of them individually become more famous than \"Monty Python\", the namesake of their group?\n",
