    "# Explore a churn dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We have extracted customer data from our ERP system. Our aim is to develop a simple churn model. That means we want to identify customers who are likely terminating their contract soon so we can target these customers directly with a marketing campaign. We have to avoid targeting satisfied customers though. Therefore, it is important to reach a good separation between dissatisfied and loyal customers.\n",

    "#### Remark:\n",
    "All features are generated by a simulation from random distributions with some underlying assumption of how people (could) behave.\n",
    "In the end, all customers have two possible states. Either they churn or they do not churn. Under the hood we implemented three types of costumers. These types determine how customers behave if they churn and how the features for our simulation are set. For example, an angry costumer has a higher churn probability than a standard costumer. But still, these standard costumers will have churn rates greater than zero. In addition, we have \"sleepy\" costumers which behave like standard costumers but have a higher churn rate, if woken up (by a call or an e-mail). Sleepy customers should not be woken up in most churn scenarios. They make it more difficult to generate an efficient model to detect churn. See the [create_churn_persona](create_churn_persona.ipynb) notebook for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Words About Toy Data\n",
    "High quality datasets are hard to find in reality. As a matter of fact, in many cases the preparations for high quality data taking take a lot more time, than large parts of the actual data analysis. However, starting early with analysis projects ensure, that you know at least some of the traps before you start datataking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, building simplified models to generate datasets from first principles is a usual way to get around. With such models you can learn bringing up the machinery and start data taking at the same time. Our dataset is such a toy set. So in several aspects it might not reflect reality at 100%. But, it still holds some key features of real data."
