    "In this exercise, we are going to build another predictive model using machine learning. Our goal is to predict real estate prices, given various attributes of the building.  The main difference to our previous example is that the target variable we are interested in, the sale price, is now a continuous range of values rather than a discrete set of classes. Time to recall the concepts of **classification** and **regression**:"

    "We speak of **classification** if the model outputs a _categorical_ variable, i.e. assigns labels to data points that divide them into groups. The machine learning algorithm often performs this task by creating and optimizing a **decision boundary** in the feature space that separates classes. (The previous chapter introduced an example of a predictive classification model.)\n",
