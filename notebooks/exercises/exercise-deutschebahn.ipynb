In most cases there is an intended interest why companies publish these datasets. However, in the case of [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml) we will not focus on a special use case or task for you. We try to start totally independent to deepen your skills and come up with your own ideas and hypotheses you might prove with these datasets. You can find several dataset in the [DB-Open-Data-Portal](https://data.deutschebahn.com/)."
