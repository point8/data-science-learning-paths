    "\n",
    "- **Real-time and Ultra-low Latency Systems**: Julia's just-in-time (JIT) compilation can introduce latency that is not suitable for real-time systems where consistent and predictable execution times are critical.\n",
    "- **Minimal resource environments**: Julia's runtime and compiler are more resource-intensive than those of some other languages, which can be a drawback for environments with strict memory or processing power limitations, such as microcontrollers or embedded systems.\n",
    "- **Operating Systems Development**: Development of operating systems typically requires languages that can compile to machine code without the overhead of a runtime environment. C and C++ are traditionally used for their close-to-the-metal capabilities, which Julia does not focus on."
