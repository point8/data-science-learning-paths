    "# (Big) Data Analysis with Python and PySpark [BDAPS3]\n",
    "\n",
    "This course takes you all the way to the ability to process and analyze data of any size. Starting from first steps Python programming, we then cover basic data analysis methods and Python tools for applying them. For truly big data sets, we teach how to harness the computing power of a cluster via PySpark."
