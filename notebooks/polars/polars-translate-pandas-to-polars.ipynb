    "[`polars`](https://www.pola.rs) as a lightning-fast DataFrame library for Rust and Python. It is an alternative to `pandas` when developing data processing pipelines, because as of late 2023 there is no real support for plotting libraries such as matplotlib or plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is written in Rust and uses the Apache Arrow data format in the background compared to numpy as the basis of pandas. Although, as of [`pandas 2.0`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html) it possible to use the Arrow data format as well in pandas, but is not the default.\n",

    "`polars` is upto 5 to 10 times faster than pandas and provides \"lazy execution\" when reading data and executing queries. When to use `polars`, when you have larger than memory data sets or when you develop a pipeline for data processing and filtering."
