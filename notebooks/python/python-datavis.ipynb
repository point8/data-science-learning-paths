    "The Python ecosystem includes several low and high level plotting/visualization libraries. The most feature-complete and popular one is [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org). Among the alternatives are [**bokeh**](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [**plotly**](https://plot.ly/python/), focusing on interactive visualizations. An example for plotly is given at the end of this notebook.\n",

    "Libraries like [**seaborn**](http://seaborn.pydata.org) are built on matplotlib and provide a high-level interface for visual data analysis. The [**pandas**](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library also provides a more high-level plotting interface that uses matplotlib. If you want to have a more general overview on libraries and interfaces, have a look for this [blog entry](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries)."
