At this point, we need to understand the concept of **lazy evaluation** and learn about the difference between Spark **transformations** and **actions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` method is a **transformation**. It is called on an RDD and returns another RDD. What actually happens under the hood when calling the method is not the computation of an RDD. When we call a transformation, we only add an operation to an **operator graph** (to be precise, a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of RDDs and operations). This graph is an abstract description of the computation to be performed - basically, a roadmap of how an RDD is turned into another one. When working with big data, not computing immediately (**lazy evaluation**) has several advantages. Our computation might take very long, and we can first build a sequence of operations before triggering the computation and waiting for the result. Also (without going to much into the technical details of Spark), building the operator graph first allows Spark to analyze it before and coming up with an optimized plan for the actual computation (e.g. by combining operations that can be performed together, by copying or moving around as little data as possible, ...)."
