    "A **time series** is made up of data points that are **indexed in time order**. This is what makes machine learning on time series data different from many other ML tasks, in which the data points are assumed to be **independent observations**. With time series data, _order in time and distance in time matter_. Observations that are close in time are likely to be correlated. We can make observations about the course that the time series takes over time, such as **trend** or **seasonality** - periodic, repeating patterns. These patterns are likely to contain information and should not be ignored. \n",
