    "# Relational Databases: ORM - Using `SQLAlchemy` with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQLAlchemy` is an example for a ORM (Object Relational Mapper). This is a high-level interface to interact with DBs of all common types. Another concept/interface is a DB-API. An example is shown in the [db-sqlite3-notebook](db-sqlite3.ipynb).\n",
    "Tabels and queries are mapped to Python objects and functions. An ORM uses a DB-API under the hood, but the user does not need to know and write SQL queries. It is a more \"pythonic\" way to interact with a DB.\n",

    "**Use**, if you have:\n",
    "- Complex database shemas and larg projects\n",
    "- Evolving DB including version control and migration\n",
    "- The need to plug the same code to different RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't use**, if you have:\n",
    "- Only one static DB that has to populated and queried once\n",
    "- (You want to avoid the overhead of defining the table classes)\n",
    "- The need for fine-grained control over all DB connections (usually not the case!)\n",
    "- Extremely good SQL skills and no understanding of Python at all"

    "![RDB_example](RDB_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A DB has much more functionalty than a simple .csv or Excel table.\n",
    "This comes with some downsides.\n",
    "We cannot simply insert data into an empty table, because there is no table at first.\n",
    "First, we have to specify how our table is designed.\n",
    "This means we have to define all columns, the data types and the relationships between different tables up front.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Yes*, you can avoid this for simple and qick-and-dirty cases by using some `pandas`/`sqlalchemy` magic, but for more complex projects and real use cases, you probably can't overcome it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)\n",
    "\n",
    "In `sqlalchemy`, each table is a Python `class`, which inherits from `sqlalchemy`'s `DeclarativeBase`.\n",
    "Within each table class, the columns and their characteristics (data types, relationships, primary keys, nullable, ...) are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some specialities up front:\n",
    "* Python classes have CamelCase names by convention. Therefore, the table class is named like `Team` (singular!). The SQL name of the table is defined in the `__tablename__` attribute and is usually a lowercase string and plural, like `\"teams\"`\n",
    "* Following the new (as of 2023) `sqlalchemy 2.0` guidelines, a column is defined like:\n",
    "    * `<column_name>: Mapped[<data_type>] = mapped_column(<options>)`\n",
    "* `Mapped`\n",
    "    * The Mapped annotation takes care of the correct translation between Python and RDBMS data types\n",
    "    * If a column is defined like `Mapped[Optional[float]]`, the fiel is allowed to be empty\n",
    "* `UniqueConstraint` \n",
    "    * A UniqueConstraint is used to tell the DB that for specific columns or combinations of columns the values must be unique and can not be inserted a second time. For example, we want every runner only one time in our table of runners.\n",
    "    * If a UniqueConstraint failed as we try to insert duplicates into our table, we will see an `IntegrityError`\n",
    "* `relationship` \n",
    "    * Relationships are introduced by the relationship() function and a mapped_column to the primary key column of the related table\n",
    "* `__repr__` \n",
    "    * This function defines what is printed if we just print table row (which is an instance of a table class). Defining it is nice to have but not crucially necessary.\n",
    " \n",
