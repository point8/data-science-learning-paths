In addition, one of the main parts is to aggregate data from different sources to one data structure (here: `pandas.DataFrame`) on which the machine learning model will be applied. In general, the ML-algorithm need numerical data as input so that strings have to be encoded (see Feature Engineering). But also units have to be checked, time series have to be set accordingly to the correct file format (see `pandas.to_datetime`). One other major part is to perform sanity checks on the data, to check for missing values and maybe compensate outliers. As mention before, all in all this take more than half of the actual time."

The sum of a row are all members of each species and the sum of a column returns the predicted members of a class. A _perfect_ classificator would have only entries on the pricipal diagonal."
