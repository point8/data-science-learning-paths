    "## Why Feature Selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons for explicitly limiting the number of features used for a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **generalization/predictive performance**: Avoid overfitting due to a large number of features.\n",
    "- **interpretability**: A model that relies on few features and can be easier to explain and interpret.\n",
    "- **saving resources**: Fewer input features can result in significantly shorter training times and less memory use - depending on the learning algorithm\n",
    "- **avoiding the curse of dimensionality**: The [curse of dimensionality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) refers to problems resulting from high dimensionality of the data. As the volume of the attribute space increases strongly with the number of dimensions/features, data quickly becomes sparse, making it difficult to detect structure or get statistically significant results."
