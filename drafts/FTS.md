# Forecasting on Time Series - Machine Learning for Prediction and Decision-Making"

Day 1:

1. Introduction to Time Series Forecasting
   - Importance of forecasting in decision-making
   - Example Problems and Datasets
     - Dataset 1: "store_sales" (daily sales transactions for 50 products in 10 stores)
       - Introducing demand forecasting and inventory management
     - Dataset 2: "air_quality_valencia" (hourly measures of air pollutants in Valencia, Spain)
       - Discussing environmental monitoring and air quality prediction
     - Dataset 3: "bicycle_sharing" (hourly usage of bike share system in Washington, D.C.)
       - Exploring forecasting for resource allocation and transportation planning
  
2. Fundamentals and Basic Terms
   - univariate and multivariate time series
   - Exploratory data analysis techniques for time series
   - time series components (trend, seasonality, cycles, irregularity)
   - Direct and recursive forecasting approaches
   - forecast horizon



3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Temporal data splitting (train/test)
   - Exogenous features (calendar features, categorical features)
   - Window features and lagged variables

4. Traditional Time Series Models and Simple Baseline Models
